    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer who has been working on websites for more than three years. Currently, I am an undergraduate student at SLIIT University pursuing a degree in information technology (Final Year). I am an active learner who enjoys experimenting with new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set. I am experienced in technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, Python, Flask, Next.js, and many more. My abilities to solve problems, think creatively and communicate clearly allow me to simplify difficult ideas and make valuable contributions to group projects. Whether delving into front-end or back-end work, I welcome all opportunities to take my abilities to new heights by accepting challenges that push me beyond what I already know. As a self-starter with a propensity for rapid learning, I readily adapt to emerging technologies and focus my efforts on delivering innovative solutions that create real impact. My goal remains one of continuous growth both as a professional and as a thinker, while exploring possibilities to contribute my talents to meaningful projects and new opportunities within the exciting technology industry."
