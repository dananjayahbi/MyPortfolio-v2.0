      <p>
        I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer who has been working on websites for more than three years. 
        Currently, I am an undergraduate student at SLIIT University pursuing a degree in information technology. 
        I am an active learner who enjoys experimenting with new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set. 
        I experienced in technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, Python, Flask, Next.js, and many more.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        My abilities to solve problems, think creatively, and communicate clearly allow me to simplify 
        difficult ideas and make valuable contributions to group projects. Whether delving into front-end 
        or back-end work, I welcome all opportunities to take my abilities to new heights by accepting challenges 
        that push me beyond what I already know.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        As a self-starter with a propensity for rapid learning, I readily adapt to emerging technologies and focus 
        my efforts on delivering innovative solutions that create real impact. My goal remains one of continuous growth 
        both as a professional and as a thinker, while exploring possibilities to contribute my talents to meaningful 
        projects and new opportunities within the exciting technology industry.
